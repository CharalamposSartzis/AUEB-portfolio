Design and development of an arcade game (e.g. Pong, Space Invaders, Asteroids) using a given graphics library (SGG) and 
the appropriate Containers and Iterators (for each case) from the C++ STL (Standard Template Library).

Emphasis was also placed on:
-the proper memory allocation and de-allocation, for the purposes of efficiency/capacity and error/exception avoidance,
and
-the hierarchy and efficient design and association of classes, using inheritance and object-oriented programming.
