## Description
This project involves the **design and development of an arcade game**, inspired by classic arcade titles such as *Pong*, *Space Invaders*, and *Asteroids*.  
It was implemented using the **SGG graphics library** together with appropriate **C++ STL Containers and Iterators** for each use case.

### Key Features & Focus
- âœ… Proper **memory allocation and deallocation** to ensure efficiency, performance, and error/exception avoidance.  
- âœ… Well-structured **class hierarchy and design**, applying inheritance and object-oriented programming principles.
