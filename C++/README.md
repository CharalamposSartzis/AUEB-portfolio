-Project's code: (link to OneDrive) https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjADZAz6_Af3smG-poNN7jAIBBva?e=RxXKL7

-Future actions: plan to move the whole project's code in GitHub.

-Description:
 Design and development of an arcade game, based on the features of old arcade games (e.g. Pong, Space Invaders, Asteroids), using a given graphics library (SGG) and 
 the appropriate Containers and Iterators (for each case) from the C++ STL (Standard Template Library).

 Emphasis was also placed on:
 -the proper memory allocation and de-allocation, for the purposes of efficiency/capacity and error/exception avoidance,
  and
 -the hierarchy and efficient design and association of classes, using inheritance and object-oriented programming.
